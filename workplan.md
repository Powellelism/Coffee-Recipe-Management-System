Week 1: Laying foundations.

(NEEDS REVIEW & FEEDBACK)
Iteration Length:
Given that we have six total weeks, we could divide this into two 3-week iterations. This length allows for significant progress to be made on features while still providing enough time for planning, execution, and review.

Iteration Planning:
Week 1: Hold an iteration planning meeting at the beginning of each 3-week block.
During this meeting, review the backlog of features and prioritize them based on importance and dependencies.
Break down selected features into smaller tasks and estimate the effort required for each task. (Planning poker.)
- Provide the links to the corresponding issues wherever applicable. Please use GitHub issues and project boards for issue tracking.
- Estimate and prioritize tasks, e.g. time vs. story points, numerical or categorical scales etc.
Assign tasks to team members based on their skills and availability; sub-teams for larger features.

Iteration Execution:
Weeks 1-3: Work on implementing the tasks assigned during the planning phase.
Track progress: Hold stand-up meetings after classes to discuss work and any issues. Can do a meeting once a week to work on things together, help each other out if we have concerns, and make plan for following week.

Iteration Retrospective:
End of Week 3: Hold an iteration retrospective meeting with the team to reflect on the iteration.
Discuss what went well, what didn't, and areas for improvement.
Make plans and adjustments for the following iteration: Identify any process bottlenecks or issues and come up with action items to address them in the next iteration. Gather feedback from our TA and incorporate necessary improvements.
Celebrate successes and acknowledge team members' contributions! :)

Reporting:
Provide regular updates to subteam and co-leaders throughout the iteration on Slack, highlighting progress and any roadblocks.
