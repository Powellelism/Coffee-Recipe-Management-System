Week 1: Laying foundations.

Iteration Length:
Given that we have six total weeks, we will divide this into three 2-week iterations. This length allows for progress to be made on features, but also allows the team to remain aware of time passing. More iterations will also allow us to check in and review our progress more frequently.

Iteration Planning:
Week 1: Hold an iteration planning meeting Thursdays as 6:30 p.m. During this meeting, we:
- Review the backlog of features and prioritize them based on importance and dependencies, outlining the next two weeks of progress.
- Break down selected features into smaller tasks, estimate the effort required for each task, and add them to Github as issues.
  - Estimate hours based on prior experience with similar projects, and prioritizing tasks based on dependencies (e.g. account creation must come before login functionality, backend must be setup before user can save recipes, etc.)
- Allow team members to pick tasks based on their skills and availability. We aim to have two people per sub-group working on closely related features.

Iteration Execution:
Weeks 1-2: Work on implementing the tasks.
Track progress: Hold stand-up meetings after classes to discuss work and any issues. Weekly meeting on Thursdays at 6:30 p.m., top floor of DIB for regular in perosn checkins. During this time, we can work on the project together, help each other with challenges, answer questions.

Iteration Retrospective:
End of Week 2: Hold an iteration retrospective meeting with the team to reflect on the iteration.
Discuss what went well, what didn't, and areas for improvement.
Make plans and adjustments for the following iteration: Identify any process bottlenecks or issues and come up with action items to address them in the next iteration. Gather feedback from our TA and incorporate necessary improvements.
Celebrate successes and acknowledge team members' contributions! :)

Reporting:
Provide regular updates to subteam and co-leaders throughout the iteration on Slack, highlighting progress and any roadblocks. 

--------
Work:
- Settled on list of features for this upcoming week; created Github issues for these tasks, including priorities and time estimates. This week we will complete issues #1 - #7.
- This upcoming week we're building foundations for our additional features, which include setting up an external database and adding login/create account functionality. To ensure our whole team is familiar with the project and these new feeatures, we agreed that everyone will write at least one test for the features made this week.
- We created rough UI sketches so we have an idea of how everythign should look. We are setting up a flow chart to demonstrate connecton of new pages.
