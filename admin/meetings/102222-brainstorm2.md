- New features?
- Pick the appropriate tech?
- Thinking about users and their expectations
- Deciding on your app's theme or mood
- Be ready for future assignments:
  - [Read through Shapeup](https://basecamp.com/shapeup)
  - The **pitch document** should contain the topics of **risks and rabbit holes** as well as a visual representation of what you are doing in the form of system diagrams and wireframes. However, our pitch should also have a **statement of purpose** as well as a section on **user personas**. The pitch may take the form of a slide deck (PDF) of no more than 16 slides or a document (PDF file) of no more than 8 pages.
  - Read through: Internal Documentation: [ADR (Architectural Decision Records)](https://adr.github.io/madr/)

## Things Discussed

1. Currently no more new features
2. Read chpt 5 & 6
3. High-fidelity wireframe prototype - buttons can click, more details
4. User personas - How different users experience
5. Risks and Rabbit holes
   - Does this require new technical work we’ve never done before?
   - Are we making assumptions about how the parts fit together?
   - Are we assuming a design solution exists that we couldn’t come up with ourselves?
   - Is there a hard decision we should settle in advance so it doesn’t trip up the team?
