# Agile - Retrospective

Conclusion from the second sprint. Opinions are from all group members.

## 1. Liked items: anything appreciated in the sprint or that made the sprint successful

Most people think our second sprint is more successful than the first sprint because we feel more like we are working together as a team. We are more organized, and more people are involved in the work. With the app coming along together, the group is able to better organize what needs to be done and how it should be done. For example, it was really nice to see a to-do list made for Thanksgiving break. Also, we like that in sprint 2, we get to actually code and use the tools we've learned in the labs throughout the quarter. This is definitely exciting and feels very accomplished especially when you see your website is working as expected. We can improve the front-end page and make the UI look great. What's more, we like to use the issue linked with tasks for each members and each branch for each problem that should be solved (because we can easily find where the latest update is).

## 2. Lacked items: things that potentially could have brought the team closer to success

We still have a lot to work on. We need to improve the coffeeshop part of the project by adding more components to it. File naming is also a problem, so we need to keep consistency. Perhaps more check ins by the team leads. Some members feel like it was missing period check-ins to make sure the members were okay and doing well. Also, we need more communication with and feedbacks from other members defintely. Lastly, we are lacking the testing parts of the projects, where so far all the testing done has been from the developers perspective. All the testings so far tend to aim at a specific function(unit test) instead of user flow(E2E test)

## 3. Learned items: any lessons learned in the sprint that would be beneficial to remember for future sprints or any process changes that could provide higher success patterns

For the most part, everything seemed to improve from the first sprint. While writing the code, we learned that input box can make different style by design. Manipulate the local storage to build our site Cooperating with other coders is hard but necessary. Even though we are all assigned with solo coding assignments, it is still important to work together as a team because many of the features and functions are interconnected. Also it would be way easier if we had a style guideline at first before coding rather than fixing up all the styling problems after the codes are done. (which we do have, but maybe not broadcast to everyone) We learned to cooperate with the backend team and build connections between front-end code and backend storage.

## 4. Longed for items: things the team desires for success or morale.

We can discuss how to optimize the front-end and back-end design and add some animation effect. We need to structure the to-do lists and have more check-ins by team leads. Communication is a very key component into success, and as we move forward the importance of communication will only increase. So far our whole team is pretty responsible with messages on slack and talking with each other, which I think we are on the right track. Besides communication, more people should be actively involved by finishing their assigned tasks earlier and more timely.
