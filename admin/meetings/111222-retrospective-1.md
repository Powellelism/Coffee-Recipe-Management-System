# Agile - Retrospective

Conclusion from the first sprint. Opinions are from all group members.

## 1. Liked items: anything appreciated in the sprint or that made the sprint successful

Most people like how our team works. Because of our great communication in backend and frontend team, and active participation of group members and leaders, we have finished most of the front-end and backend coding within the first sprint (about a wekk and half). Also by splitting the work to everyone so the whole team can contribute, as well as the leaders would ask about the progress and make sure everyone is on track, we can get our work done in an efficient way. By performing such great teamwork, we also got some good practices like making pull request and git branches and deepened the understanding of front-end design and completed the writing of front-end code within the task.

## 2. Lacked items: things that potentially could have brought the team closer to success

Although we strive to communicate with others more frequently, we still lack communication among team members. Since evryone has different schedules, the majority of our conversation is async, which takes lots of time to receive feedback and turn it into action. Sometimes members are only responsive when directly approached, which is not a preferred way of communication. That is to say, increasing timely communication would greatly improve team dynamics since it would allow us to tackle problems more proficiently. We also could have more meetings within the smaller group since we don't need the whole team to be present. This would help our group connect better. Due to the lack of communication and some members being unresponsible to their work, the work distribution is not even. Given that we have 10 people, some students do significantly more than others. Lastly, we need to improve our code writing skills.

## 3. Learned items: any lessons learned in the sprint that would be beneficial to remember for future sprints or any process changes that could provide higher success patterns

A lot of lessons learned during the first sprint. First, we gained a deeper understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript like their features and details. For GitHub actions, even after the lab, is still confusing and hard to manipulate with. Next, if we encounter any problem during our work, asking for group members' help is an efficient way to solve problems. Besides that, planning ahead is really important as we may not be as efficient as we thought we are, especially when we are overwhelmed with workloads from other classes.
What's more, set up an overall project structure would be helpful in teamwork such as assigning each person by pages or specific tasks. Lastly, it is not enough to only write functioning code, you also have to make it understandable to other people.

## 4. Longed for items: things the team desires for success or morale.

From the coding perspective, we will keep consistent in coding styles and re-direction logic, and we can discuss how to optimize the front-end UI design and some animation effects. We will also finish the remaining portion ASAP. From the team perspective, we need more discussions about logic and structure, and most importantly, we need more communication among team members. Every team member must be more engaged and self-motivated.
