# Discussed
[Pitch Requirement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LF4NpXGQUJC90t-SIQGa2LHOEYkbGk_7KShogXaqtNU/edit?usp=sharing)
1. Phone or desktop? 
   - Phone - app store, Swift
   - Just desktop, no phone layout
   - Either a bunch of files or assemble - our decision
2. Js lib? 
   - Research - why include, pros and cons
   - Document reasons (e.g. math, maybe like saving time, important features)
   - Core functions of Electron
3. Pitch meeting before Nov.1
   - All meet together, boss-management question
   - TA review
   - When2Meet form
4. Risk and Rabbit holes
   - As developers, we miss anything?
   - e.g. Viewing PDF, user expect, implement ... will take too much time/space, so use a different lib or something; define as out of scope
   - Another analysis of potential negative outcome of our project
