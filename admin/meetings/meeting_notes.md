Constantly updated meeting notes! Find the most recent one on top.

* 05/02:
    * Need to put features into Github, link issues. Update workplan.md on repo.
    * Familiarized ourselves with Justin's repo. 

    * Hours available: 8-10 hours per person? People present voted that. So around 400 hours total?

    * Draw out UI?
    * Extending to "drinks", not just coffee.
    * Vanilla JS for accessibility/compatibility, better backend for navigation setup.
    * Couple images too big--we will likely use new images though.
    * New logo--Lea.

    * Creation of recipe: can they choose inappropriate things? ChatGPT checked: does not comply, so we're good.

    * Wireframe diagram done for following scenarios
        * User can browse popular and recent recipes without logging in
        * User can register 
        * User can login
        * User can reset password
        * User can see popular and recent recipes know logged in with save, add comment, and rate buttons
        * User can create recipes
        * User can choose to fill out a expanding list to write down a recipe
        * User can choose to autogenerate a recipe based on responses to questions which is fed into a LLM

    * **Important** first sprint only to get the team accustomed to the repo we will assign tests to be written by everyone on the team. Please write tests to learn the repo and gauge understanding.

* 05/01:

    * What's been done: Github project has been set up. 

    * Went over our to-do list:
        * Finalize our list of features for the project
        * Please check out: [To-Do Spreadsheet] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pB0eEN4R1vffWt2BwSEUpGWTNUPttBIS_8201fQf7qk/edit#gid=0)
    * Get familiar with the repository: dig around, maybe create a diagram of the file structure. Justin said he could give us an in-depth review.
    * Planning poker: estimate time for features
    * Prioritize features: Based on what? Interest?
    * Start putting on Github, assigning people. Subteams possible. 
        * Assignments: when people have chosen features to work on, they should break it down into tasks, add those tasks to Github, and include time estimates. Time estimate should be reviewed by Emin/I or another person on subteam.
        * Tasks that all features should have: testing. Should be complete first.
    * Set up weekly meetings: It's been a bit tough to coordinate 10 people. Our plan is to have weekly meetings every Thursday at 6:30 p.m. on the top floor of the DIB. Our goal is to have at least two people working on each feature, so they would be your sub-team. If we all make sure at least one person from our sub-team is at the meeting, then we can update each other (like a buddy system). So sub-teams are repsonsible for keeping each other on track.

    * Link tasks to features with issue #
    * Github todo:
        * Add feature to Github
        * Add to the description: Write out your testing scenario(s) for this feature. Ex: Given (example start state), when (the user takes example action), then (this should happen). Let’s write these tests first, then start implementing!
        * Break down into tasks, add to Github
            * Link tasks to feature
        * Assign tasks to people
        * Add time estimates —> if you estimate a task time, ask Emin or Lea for review

    * Keep the project coffee related? Emin feels it is limiting, so we should branch out into food.

* 04/25:

    * Meeting with TA. We will need to do weekly workplans

* 04/21:
    * Completed slides for project assessment. Created plan for reviewing projects: Everyone is randomly assigned one project and a second optional project for review. Canva slides have review specifications, and link to Google sheets on Slack for project assignment.
    * Need to do: Finalize project selection after project review complete.

* 04/12:

    * Items: Narrow down our list of projects, discuss team video, code of conduct, and team name

    * Project selection: Went through each of our github repos and project demos (when available)

    * Fortune Teller: Adarsh
        * Pros: Works well, looks nice.
        * Cons: Not many ideas for features or visual upgrades. Tests only work half the time, potentially a bit buggy.

    * To-Do List: Rahul
        * Pros: Many potential features to add. Code is readable, well-named variables, MVP design pattern.
        * Cons: Buggy. Some features don’t work, missing documentation and tests (currently only UI tests)

    * Coffee Recipes: Justin
        * Pros: Clean foundation, not buggy. Many features to add: Could add users/login, ability to share recipes with friends, hottest recipes/most liked lists, searching nearby coffee shops if they can make your coffee. 
        * Cons: We need to be careful not to overshoot on features.

    * To-Do List: Mark
        * Pros: Many potential features to add.
        * Cons: Quite buggy.

    * Fortune Teller: Jenny and Steven
        * Pros: Looks great, really cool animations. Could add features like user/login, potentially multiplayer- ability to compete with friends.
        * Cons: Tests cover ~50% of code.

    * PantryPal Recipe Generator: Chau
        * Pros: Strong foundation with ChatGPT/DALL-E API. 
        * Cons: Potential JavaFX learning curve.

    * PantryPal Recipe Generator: Lea
        * Pros: Lots of features already in existence: user/login, external database, save/edit recipes, voice-to-text generation. Organized, not buggy.
        * Cons: Potential JavaFX learning curve. Lots of code, backend heavy. New features to add?

    * Friend Finder: Emin
        * Pros: Sounds cool, space for new features to add.
        * Cons: We couldn’t find a ReadMeeee

    * Idea from Jenny: Combining features like DALL-E or ChatGPT generation using APIs and adding to coffee recipe website.

    * Final project vote will be on Slack.

    * Team video: Settled on Adarsh’s idea. Link for inspo: https://youtu.be/SOwJJPZKIys?t=85. We’ll have photos of ourselves edited onto faces of the actors. Lea will send timestamps for 10 faces where we could add our photos and everyone can pick one.

    * Team name: Will vote on Slack. 

    * Attendance (just so we know who to update):
    * Jenny, Lea, Chau, Mark, Steven, Justin, Adarsh, Rahul
