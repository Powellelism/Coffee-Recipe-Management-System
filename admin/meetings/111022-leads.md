# Suggestion

1. (put in pitch) Measure app performance: **Response** (process events in under 50ms) and **Load**(deliver content and become interactive in under 5 seconds)
   - Both can be manually measured using Chrome DevTools. Load : In the performance tab, click "Start profiling and reload page" and look at the "Summary" tab for page loading time. Response : In the performance tab, click "Record"; interact somehow with the website (e.g. click the button); click "Stop"; look at the "Event Log" tab for the corresponding event. You can search for a particular event (e.g. onclick) in the "Filter" textfield.
2. Generally use relative distance
3. [HTML&CSS styles](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#HTML_Style_Rules)
4. Pipeline
   1. Human review pull request, tools integrated (style, run tests, generate documentation), run as github actions (include other tools in .yml)
   2. Writing basic unit tests, which tool, doc generator
   3. Write how we organize code, rule pull request, rule review
   4. Video: me showing this triggered, pull request, do x y, show z deliverables
   5. Linter/doc gen link into github actions
