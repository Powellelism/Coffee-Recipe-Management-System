# Reviewing the goal for the sprint

The goal is to check the overall progress on this project.

# Demonstrating new features implemented

Since this is the first week of actual coding, we are still preparing more features and designing the structure of the project. By the end of this week, we have accomplished most of the frontend work such as building pages with HTML and CSS, and most of the Javascript files for the backend. Mingyi, as the lead of the frontend, and Jacky, as the lead of the backend, have demonstrated and explained their latest work. We also discussed the pipeline, ADRs, and other sturctual work during our weekly in-person meetings.

A demo of pages can be found [here by figma (version 2)](https://www.figma.com/file/mACNR0meaqsqXqtvanpEsK/Prototype-1-Cafe?node-id=0%3A1)

Some screenshots of the current pages are here:
