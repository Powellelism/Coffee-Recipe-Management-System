# Use Github Issues

## Context and Problem Statement

In order to distribute work more directly and clearly to every group members, we need to find a way to show everybody's workload directly.

## Considered Options

- Github Issues
- Broadcast through Slack channel

## Decision Outcome

We choose to use Github Issues because it is easy for us to see everybody's workload. People will get specific work requirements under the Issue bar in the repo, and once they are done, they can check it off, which is also easier for team and frontend/backend leads to review their work.
