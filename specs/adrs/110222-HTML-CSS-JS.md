# Use Plain HTML, CSS, Javascript as the core languages for our project

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to think about how to complete this project with technologies that everybody is familiar with.

## Considered Options

- Plain HTML, CSS, Js
- Electron
- Other lib

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Plain HTML, CSS, Js" because these are sufficient enough to finish our project. Everybody on the team is familiar with them, so we reduce the risk of using a new technology (electron, for example)
