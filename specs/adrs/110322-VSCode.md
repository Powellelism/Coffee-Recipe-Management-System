# Use VSCode as our default editor

## Context and Problem Statement

The decision between editor or IDE.

## Considered Options

- VSCode
- IDE (Visual Studio etc.)

## Decision Outcome

VSCode works better with github and git, providing faster pull/push from github. With integrated feature such as live server, developers can see how the website looks at live, which makes coding a lot easier. At the same time, VSCode supports multi-language programming.
