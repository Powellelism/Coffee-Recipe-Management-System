# Use Github Page for Auto-generated Documentation

## Context and Problem Statement

Since we are using jsdoc as a part of our CI/CD pipeline for documentation generation, we need a place to store and review our current documentation.

## Considered Options

- Github Pages
- Saved on repo

## Decision Outcome

We choose to use Github Pages because running jsdoc as github action will not automatically save those documents to the repo by making another commit. Therefore, it will be easy to deploy these documents on github page. Once a new commit is pushed to that branch, it will cover the old documentation on that page link, so we do not need to worry about the version of the documents, which will always be the latest.
